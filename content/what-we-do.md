<h3>What We Do</h3>

<p class="intro-text">Warm Winters is an international nonprofit tackling<br class="small-break"> homelessness with the power of youth.</p>

<p class="paragraph-text">Our youth volunteers take warm clothing from ski resort lost-and-founds in the US, Canada, and Australia and donate it to surrounding homeless communities. We also provide leadership training for youth in schools across the world, teaching them how to start a movement and  give back in their communities.</p>
